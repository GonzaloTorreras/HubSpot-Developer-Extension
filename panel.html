        <h1>Developer Info</h1>
        <p>Stay Tuned! We are working with HubSpot to find a way to securely pull in the developer info, a change on HubSpot's end disables our ability to pull it.</p>
        <p>If/when we get this feature working we will be able to explore doing a lot more powerful things for you as developers. Some possible examples of interesting things might be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Displaying modules that are in flex columns with quick access to their field data.</li>
            <li>Highlighting field data being outputted in modules</li>
            <li>Have a nice UI that lets you get at the specific developer info you want, in a more friendly format than a gigantic json array.</li>
        </ul>
        <!--<p style="color:#fff;">This feature is in testing, and in-fact is expected to stop working around May 23rd due to a HubSpot change. This feature pulls the developer info for the current HubSpot page, formats it into human readable form, with collapsable sections and
            quick-copy functionality. Simply click on the key name and it will copy the HubL required to get that variable, click on the value itself to simply copy the current value.</p>
        <h2 style="color:#fff;">This feature requires a special chrome permission</h2>
        <p style="color:#fff;">Currently this feature requires the a chrome permission that gives the extension access to your basic tab information. No data of yours is stored nor transmitted anywhere. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TheWebTech/HubSpot-Developer-Extension/wiki/Privacy-Policy">Our Privacy Policy</a>            explains in detail how data is handled.</p>-->
