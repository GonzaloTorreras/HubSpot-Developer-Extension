# New Ownership. Same great hair!
The ownership change of the repo, doesn't really affect much, just detaches Will's face and username from showing up when people link the repo. While we haven't seen anyone actually confused over the extension being community driven and not an official HubSpot product. We thought we're hitting a point in popularity that being more obvious with this is probably a good idea. Nothing significant is changing because of this, I had been kinda leading the charge on the extension since it hit the chrome web store. Will still has contributor status, and can make updates. This chrome extension retains it's mission of improving HubSpot's developer experience from the outside.

A Chrome/Chromium extension for HubSpot Developers that adds useful shortcuts to commonly used HubSpot Query Parameters, and tools for making HubSpot Development easier and more enjoyable. For details on the many features we have a wiki page detailing them:[Feature Breakdown](https://github.com/williamspiro/HubSpot-Developer-Extension/wiki/Feature-Breakdown)

If you like the extension, please [rate and review it](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hubspot-developer-extensi/gebemkdecnlgbcanplbgdpcffpdnfdfo/reviews) to help it get visibility in the chrome store. The more eyes on it, the more likely more contributors, and more high quality updates!

[We're in the Chrome Store!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hubspot-developer-extensi/gebemkdecnlgbcanplbgdpcffpdnfdfo)
The Chrome store version is the stable build, and will get updates over time.

If you prefer to fly by the seat of your pants with wreckless abandon, [We have the a beta build of the extension.](https://github.com/williamspiro/HubSpot-Developer-Extension/wiki/How-to-use-the-Beta-version-of-the-extension)


Let us know in issues if you run into any bugs, please also let us know if you're seeing the issue in the beta version.

## An update to the stable build was released, how long will it take to get to me?
Google Chrome updates extensions only under certain situations when running. The easiest way to get the freshest version of the extension is to close google chrome completely and re-open it. You can tell if you're running the latest version by checking the version number on the manage extensions screen and comparing with our [releases page.](https://github.com/williamspiro/HubSpot-Developer-Extension/releases)

## Is this an official HubSpot chrome extension?
Not officially, but officially we do have a couple contributors who work for HubSpot.

The extension was built by a group of developers who build sites, custom modules, landing pages, etc. on HubSpot. We built it for people like us and hope that you get some good use out of it.

While this is not an official HubSpot brand product, HubSpot's developers are aware of it's existence and generally seem to approve of it. In-fact we've been told many HubSpotters use the extension themselves.

We claim no legal rights to the HubSpot name/brand. We have posed the question of if it was okay to have the name HubSpot in the extension's name. It appears atleast for now HubSpot is okay with us using the name. We have no intention of misrepresenting the affiliation to HubSpot, but we also do appreciate being able to use the name, as without it - it would be harder for people to find.

### Testimonials
>The Developer Extension is the best thing I have seen for developers on the HubSpot Platform. It saves time digging through what has otherwise become a very confusing and cumbersome menu for developers to get to the critical sections they need fast.
